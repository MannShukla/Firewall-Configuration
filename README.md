# üîê Firewall Configuration using UFW (Linux)

## üìå Objective
The goal of this task is to configure and test basic firewall rules on a Linux system using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall). We will block and allow specific ports, test the connections, and document the process.

‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Update & Install UFW
First, I updated the system's package list and installed UFW. In my case, it was already installed and up-to-date.

```Bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ufw -y
```


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Enable the Firewall
With UFW installed, I enabled it. This makes the firewall active immediately and ensures it starts automatically on system boot.

```Bash

sudo ufw enable
```


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Status Check
I checked the firewall's status to see the default rules. By default, UFW denies all incoming traffic and allows all outgoing traffic. An existing rule allowed SSH on port 22.

```Bash

sudo ufw status verbose
```


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Block Port 23 (Telnet)
Next, I added a rule to deny all incoming traffic on port 23, which is used by the Telnet protocol.

```Bash

sudo ufw deny 23/tcp
```


### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Telnet Block Rule
To confirm the rule was working, I tried to connect to localhost on port 23. The connection was immediately refused, which confirms the firewall is successfully blocking the port.

```Bash

telnet localhost 23
```


### 6Ô∏è‚É£ (Bonus) Block & Test Port 21 (FTP)
To further demonstrate the firewall's capabilities, I also blocked and tested port 21 (FTP). As expected, this connection was also refused.

```Bash

sudo ufw deny 21/tcp
telnet localhost 21
```


### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Final Rule Status
A final status check shows the new DENY rules for both port 21 and port 23 are active. The numbered option makes it easy to reference rules for deletion.

```Bash

sudo ufw status numbered
```


### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Cleanup & Restore State
Finally, I removed the block rules for ports 21 and 23 to restore the firewall to its original configuration, leaving only the default SSH rule.

```Bash

sudo ufw delete deny 23/tcp
sudo ufw delete deny 21/tcp
```


üìú Command Summary
Here is the complete sequence of commands used to enable, configure, test, and clean up the firewall rules.



```Bash

# Enable the firewall
sudo ufw enable

# Check initial status
sudo ufw status verbose

# Add a rule to block Port 23 and test it
sudo ufw deny 23/tcp
telnet localhost 23

# Add a rule to block Port 21 and test it (Bonus)
sudo ufw deny 21/tcp
telnet localhost 21

# View the final list of active rules with numbers
sudo ufw status numbered

# Delete the test rules to clean up
sudo ufw delete deny 23/tcp
sudo ufw delete deny 21/tcp
```



## üìà Summary: How a Firewall Filters Traffic
A firewall acts as a digital gatekeeper for a network. It inspects incoming and outgoing data packets against a predefined set of security rules. Each packet contains information like its source IP address, destination IP address, port number, and protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP).

If a packet's information matches a "deny" rule or fails to match any "allow" rule, the firewall drops the packet, preventing it from reaching its destination. This simple but powerful process is fundamental to network security, as it blocks unauthorized access and protects against many common cyber threats.
